    <string name="coordinator_article">Android is a mobile operating system (OS) currently developed by Google,
        based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices
        such as smartphones and tablets.
        \n\nAndroid was initially authored by Android, Inc., which Google bought in 2005,[17]
        and unveiled it in 2007, along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance â€“
        a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to
        advancing open standards for mobile devices.
        \n\nAndroid\'s source code is released by Google under open source licenses,
        although most Android devices ultimately ship with both open source and proprietary software,
        including required proprietary components for Google\'s services.
